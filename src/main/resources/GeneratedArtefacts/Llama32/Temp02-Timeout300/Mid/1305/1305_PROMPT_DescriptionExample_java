As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1305;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given two binary search trees "root1" and "root2", return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.

[--Example 1--]
Input: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
Output: [0,1,1,2,3,4]

[--Example 2--]
Input: root1 = [1,null,8], root2 = [8,1]
Output: [1,1,8,8]
