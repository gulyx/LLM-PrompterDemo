As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2807;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given the head of a linked list "head", in which each node contains an integer value.

Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal to the "greatest common divisor" of them.

Return the linked list after insertion.

The "greatest common divisor" of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
[--Example 1--]
Input: head = [18,6,10,3]
Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]
[--Example 2--]
Input: head = [7]
Output: [7]
