As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'861_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an "m x n" binary matrix "grid".

A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all "0"'s to "1"'s, and all "1"'s to "0"'s).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).
[--Example 1--]
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
[--Example 2--]
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 1
