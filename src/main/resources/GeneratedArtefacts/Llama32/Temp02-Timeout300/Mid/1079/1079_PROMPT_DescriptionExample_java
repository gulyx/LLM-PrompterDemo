As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1079;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You have "n" "tiles", where each tile has one letter "tiles[i]" printed on it.

Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make using the letters printed on those "tiles".
[--Example 1--]
Input: tiles = "AAB"
Output: 8

[--Example 2--]
Input: tiles = "AAABBC"
Output: 188

[--Example 3--]
Input: tiles = "V"
