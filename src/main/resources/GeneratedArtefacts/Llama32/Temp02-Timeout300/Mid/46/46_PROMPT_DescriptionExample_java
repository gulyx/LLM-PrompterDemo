As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.46;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an array "nums" of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.


[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
[--Example 3--]
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
