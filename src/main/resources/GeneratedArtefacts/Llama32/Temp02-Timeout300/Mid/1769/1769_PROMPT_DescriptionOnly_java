As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1769;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You have "n" boxes. You are given a binary string "boxes" of length n, where "boxes[i]" is "'0'" if the "ith" box is empty, and "'1'" if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box "i" is adjacent to box "j" if "abs(i - j) == 1". Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array "answer" of size "n", where "answer[i]" is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the "ith" box.

Each "answer[i]" is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.
