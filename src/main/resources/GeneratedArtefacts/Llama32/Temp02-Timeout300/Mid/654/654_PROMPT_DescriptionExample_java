As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.654;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "nums" with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from "nums" using the following algorithm:

1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in "nums".
2. Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
3. Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.
Return the maximum binary tree built from "nums".


[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]


[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,null,2,null,1]
