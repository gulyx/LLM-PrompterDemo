As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2610;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "nums". You need to create a 2D array from "nums" satisfying the following conditions:

The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array "nums".
Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

Constraints:

"1 <= nums.length <= 200"
"1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length"
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
