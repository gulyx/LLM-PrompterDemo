As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2396_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
An integer "n" is strictly palindromic if, for every base "b" between "2" and "n - 2" (inclusive), the string representation of the integer "n" in base "b" is palindromic.

Given an integer "n", return "true" if "n" is strictly palindromic and "false" otherwise.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
