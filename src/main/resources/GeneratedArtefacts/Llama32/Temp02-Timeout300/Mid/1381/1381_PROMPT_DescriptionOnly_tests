As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1381_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1381;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1381.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the "CustomStack" class:

"CustomStack(int maxSize)" Initializes the object with "maxSize" which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
"void push(int x)" Adds "x" to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the "maxSize".
"int pop()" Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
"void inc(int k, int val)" Increments the bottom "k" elements of the stack by "val". If there are less than "k" elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.
