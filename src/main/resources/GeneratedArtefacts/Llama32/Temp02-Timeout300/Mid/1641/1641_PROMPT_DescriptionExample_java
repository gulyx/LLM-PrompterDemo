As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1641;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an integer "n", return the number of strings of length "n" that consist only of vowels ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u") and are lexicographically sorted.

A string "s" is lexicographically sorted if for all valid "i", "s[i]" is the same as or comes before "s[i+1]" in the alphabet.

Constraints:

* "1 <= n <= 50" 
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
[--Example 3--]
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045
