As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1829_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given a sorted array "nums" of "n" non-negative integers and an integer "maximumBit". You want to perform the following query "n" times:

1. Find a non-negative integer "k < 2^maximumBit" such that "nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k" is maximized. "k" is the answer to the "i^th" query.

2. Remove the last element from the current array "nums".

Return an array "answer", where "answer[i]" is the answer to the "i^th" query.


Constraints:

* "nums.length == n"
* "1 <= n <= 10^5"
* "1 <= maximumBit <= 20"
* "0 <= nums[i] < 2^maximumBit"
* "nums​​​" is sorted in ascending order.
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [0,1,1,3], maximumBit = 2
Output: [0,3,2,3]
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [2,3,4,7], maximumBit = 3
Output: [5,2,6,5]
[--Example 3--]
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,5,7], maximumBit = 3
Output: [4,3,6,4,6,7]
