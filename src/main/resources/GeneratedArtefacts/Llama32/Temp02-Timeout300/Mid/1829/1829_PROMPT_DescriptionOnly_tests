As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1829_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1829;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1829.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a sorted array "nums" of "n" non-negative integers and an integer "maximumBit". You want to perform the following query "n" times:

1. Find a non-negative integer "k < 2^maximumBit" such that "nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k" is maximized. "k" is the answer to the "i^th" query.

2. Remove the last element from the current array "nums".

Return an array "answer", where "answer[i]" is the answer to the "i^th" query.


Constraints:

* "nums.length == n"
* "1 <= n <= 10^5"
* "1 <= maximumBit <= 20"
* "0 <= nums[i] < 2^maximumBit"
* "nums​​​" is sorted in ascending order.
