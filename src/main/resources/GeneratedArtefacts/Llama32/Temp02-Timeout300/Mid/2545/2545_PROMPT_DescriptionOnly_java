As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2545;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
There is a class with "m" students and "n" exams. You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" integer matrix "score", where each row represents one student and "score[i][j]" denotes the score the "ith" student got in the "jth" exam. The matrix "score" contains distinct integers only.

You are also given an integer "k". Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the "kth" (0-indexed) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return the matrix after sorting it.
