As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2545_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2545;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2545.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
There is a class with "m" students and "n" exams. You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" integer matrix "score", where each row represents one student and "score[i][j]" denotes the score the "ith" student got in the "jth" exam. The matrix "score" contains distinct integers only.

You are also given an integer "k". Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the "kth" (0-indexed) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return the matrix after sorting it.
