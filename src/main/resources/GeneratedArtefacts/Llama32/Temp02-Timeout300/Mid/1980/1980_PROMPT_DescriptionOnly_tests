As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1980_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1980;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1980.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given an array of strings "nums" containing "n" unique binary strings each of length "n", return a binary string of length "n" that does not appear in "nums". If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.
