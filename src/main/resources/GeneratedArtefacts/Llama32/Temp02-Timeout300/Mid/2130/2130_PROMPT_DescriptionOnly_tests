As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2130_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2130;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2130.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
In a linked list of size "n", where n is even, the "ith" node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the "(n-1-i)th" node, if "0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1".

For example, if "n = 4", then node "0" is the twin of node "3", and node "1" is the twin of node "2". These are the only nodes with twins for "n = 4".
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the "head" of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
