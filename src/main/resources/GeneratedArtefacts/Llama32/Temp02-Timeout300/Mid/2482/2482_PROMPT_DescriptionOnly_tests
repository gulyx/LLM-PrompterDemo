As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2482_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2482;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2482.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" binary matrix "grid".

A 0-indexed "m x n" difference matrix "diff" is created with the following procedure:

Let the number of ones in the "iᵗʰ" row be "onesRowᵢ".

Let the number of ones in the "jᵗʰ" column be "onesColⱼ".

Let the number of zeros in the "iᵗʰ" row be "zerosRowᵢ".

Let the number of zeros in the "jᵗʰ" column be "zerosColⱼ".

"diff[i][j] = onesRowᵢ + onesColⱼ - zerosRowᵢ - zerosColⱼ"

Return the difference matrix "diff".
