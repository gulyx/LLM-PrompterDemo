As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2482;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" binary matrix "grid".

A 0-indexed "m x n" difference matrix "diff" is created with the following procedure:

Let the number of ones in the "iᵗʰ" row be "onesRowᵢ".

Let the number of ones in the "jᵗʰ" column be "onesColⱼ".

Let the number of zeros in the "iᵗʰ" row be "zerosRowᵢ".

Let the number of zeros in the "jᵗʰ" column be "zerosColⱼ".

"diff[i][j] = onesRowᵢ + onesColⱼ - zerosRowᵢ - zerosColⱼ"

Return the difference matrix "diff".
[--Example 1--]
Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]

[--Example 2--]
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]
