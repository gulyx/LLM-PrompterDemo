As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2221_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array "nums", where "nums[i]" is a digit between "0" and "9" (inclusive).

The triangular sum of "nums" is the value of the only element present in "nums" after the following process terminates:

1. Let "nums" comprise of "n" elements. If "n == 1", end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array "newNums" of length "n - 1".

2. For each index "i", where "0 <= i < n - 1", assign the value of "newNums[i]" as "(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10", where "%" denotes modulo operator.

3. Replace the array "nums" with "newNums".

4. Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the triangular sum of "nums".
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [5]
Output: 5
