As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '3324_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.3324;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.3324.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a string "target".

Alice is going to type "target" on her computer using a special keyboard that has only two keys:

* Key 1 appends the character ""a"" to the string on the screen.
* Key 2 changes the last character of the string on the screen to its next character in the English alphabet. For example, ""c"" changes to ""d"" and ""z"" changes to ""a"".
Note that initially there is an empty string """" on the screen, so she can only press key 1.

Return a list of all strings that appear on the screen as Alice types "target", in the order they appear, using the minimum key presses.


Constraints:

* "1 <= target.length <= 400"
* "target" consists only of lowercase English letters.
