As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1877;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
The pair sum of a pair "(a,b)" is equal to "a + b". The maximum pair sum is the largest pair sum in a list of pairs.

For example, if we have pairs "(1,5)", "(2,3)", and "(4,4)", the maximum pair sum would be "max(1+5, 2+3, 4+4) = max(6, 5, 8) = 8".
Given an array "nums" of even length "n", pair up the elements of nums into "n / 2" pairs such that:

Each element of "nums" is in exactly one pair, and
The maximum pair sum is minimized.
Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [3,5,2,3]
Output: 7
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [3,5,4,2,4,6]
Output: 8
