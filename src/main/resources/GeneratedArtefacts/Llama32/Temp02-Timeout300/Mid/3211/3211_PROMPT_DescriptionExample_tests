As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '3211_DescriptionExample_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.3211;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.3211.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a positive integer "n".
A binary string "x" is "valid" if all substrings of "x" of length 2 contain "at least" one "1".
Return all "valid" strings with length "n", in "any" order.

[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 3
Output: ["010","011","101","110","111"]
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 1
Output: ["0","1"]
