As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1347;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given two strings of the same length "s" and "t". In one step you can choose any character of "t" and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make "t" an anagram of "s".

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.


[--Example 1--]
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
[--Example 2--]
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5

[--Example 3--]
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
