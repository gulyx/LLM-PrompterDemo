As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1630_DescriptionExample_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1630;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1630.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence "s" is arithmetic if and only if "s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] " for all valid "i"
You are given an array of "n" integers, "nums", and two arrays of "m" integers each, "l" and "r", representing the "m" range queries, where the "ith" query is the range "[l[i], r[i]]". All the arrays are 0-indexed.
Return a list of "boolean" elements "answer", where "answer[i]" is "true" if the subarray "nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]" can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and "false" otherwise.
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [4,6,5,9,3,7], l = [0,0,2], r = [2,3,5]
Output: [true,false,true]

[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [-12,-9,-3,-12,-6,15,20,-25,-20,-15,-10], l = [0,1,6,4,8,7], r = [4,4,9,7,9,10]
Output: [false,true,false,false,true,true]
