As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1817_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer "k". The "logs" are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each "logs[i] = [IDi, timei]" indicates that the user with "IDi" performed an action at the minute "timei".

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array "answer" of size "k" such that, for each "j" ("1 <= j <= k"), "answer[j]" is the number of users whose UAM equals "j".

Return the array "answer" as described above.
