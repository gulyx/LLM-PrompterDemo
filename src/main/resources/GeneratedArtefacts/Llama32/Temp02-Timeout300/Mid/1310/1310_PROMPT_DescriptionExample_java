As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1310;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an array "arr" of positive integers. You are also given the array "queries" where "queries[i] = [lefti, righti]".

For each query "i" compute the XOR of elements from "lefti" to "righti" (that is, arr[lefti] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[righti]" ).

Return an array "answer" where "answer[i]" is the answer to the "ith" query.
[--Example 1--]
Input: arr = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3],[3,3]]
Output: [2,7,14,8] 
[--Example 2--]
Input: arr = [4,8,2,10], queries = [[2,3],[1,3],[0,0],[0,3]]
Output: [8,0,4,4]
