As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1415;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
A happy string is a string that:

* consists only of letters of the set "['a', 'b', 'c']".
* "s[i] != s[i + 1]" for all values of "i" from "1" to "s.length - 1" (string is 1-indexed).

For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.

Given two integers "n" and "k", consider a list of all happy strings of length "n" sorted in lexicographical order.

Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than "k" happy strings of length "n".


Constraints:

* "1 <= n <= 10"
* "1 <= k <= 100"
