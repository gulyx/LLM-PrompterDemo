As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2997_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array "nums" and a positive integer "k".

You can apply the following operation on the array any number of times:

* Choose any element of the array and flip a bit in its binary representation. Flipping a bit means changing a "0" to "1" or vice versa.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the bitwise "XOR" of all elements of the final array equal to "k".

Note that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number "(101)_2" you can flip the fourth bit and obtain "(1101)_2".

Constraints:

* "1 <= nums.length <= 10^5"
* "0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6"
* "0 <= k <= 10^6"
