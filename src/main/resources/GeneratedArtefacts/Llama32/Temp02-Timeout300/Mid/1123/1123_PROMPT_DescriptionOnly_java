As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1123;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given the "root" of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

* The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
* The depth of the root of the tree is "0". if the depth of a node is "d", the depth of each of its children is "d + 1".
* The lowest common ancestor of a set "S" of nodes, is the node "A" with the largest depth such that every node in "S" is in the subtree with root "A".

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range "[1, 1000]".
* "0 <= Node.val <= 1000"
* The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
