As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2433_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "pref" of size "n". Find and return the array "arr" of size "n" that satisfies:

"pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]".
Note that "^" denotes the bitwise-xor operation.

It can be proven that the answer is unique.
[--Example 1--]
Input: pref = [5,2,0,3,1]
Output: [5,7,2,3,2]
[--Example 2--]
Input: pref = [13]
Output: [13]
