As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1302_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1302;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1302.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given the "root" of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range "[1, 104]".
"1 <= Node.val <= 100"
