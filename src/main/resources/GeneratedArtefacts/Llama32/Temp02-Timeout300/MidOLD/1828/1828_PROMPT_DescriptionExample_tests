As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1828_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an array "points" points where "points[i] = [xi, yi]" is the coordinates of the "ith" i th point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the "same" same coordinates.
You are also given an array "queries" where "queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]" describes a circle centered at "(xj, yj)" with a radius of "rj".
For each query "queries[j]", compute the number of points "inside" the "jth" circle. Points "on the border" of the circle are considered "inside" .
Return an array "answer", where "answer[j]" is the answer to the to the "jth" query.

[--Example 1--]
Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
Output: [3,2,2]
[--Example 2--]
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], queries = [[1,2,2],[2,2,2],[4,3,2],[4,3,3]]
Output: [2,3,2,4]
