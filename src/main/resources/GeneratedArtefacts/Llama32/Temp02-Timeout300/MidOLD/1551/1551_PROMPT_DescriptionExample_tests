As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1551_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You have an array "arr" of length "n" where "arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1" for all valid values of "I" (i.e., "0 <= i < n").

In one operation, you can select two indices "x" and "y" where "0 <= x, y < n" and subtract "1" from "arr[x]" and add "1" to "arr[y]" (i.e., perform "arr[x] -=1" and "arr[y] += 1"). The goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. It is guaranteed that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.

Given an integer "n", the length of the array, return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of arr equal.
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 6
Output: 9
