As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'78_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an integer array "nums" of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
