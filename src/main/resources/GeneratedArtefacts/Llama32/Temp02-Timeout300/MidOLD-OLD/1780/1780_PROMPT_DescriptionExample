As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1780_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an integer "n", return "true" if it is possible to represent "n" as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return "false".

An integer "y" is a power of three if there exists an integer "x" such that "y == 3x".
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 12
Output: true
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 91
Output: true
[--Example 3--]
Input: n = 21
Output: false
