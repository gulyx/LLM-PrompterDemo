As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2698_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given a positive integer "n", return the punishment number of "n".

The punishment number of "n" is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers "i" such that:
- "1 <= i <= n"
- The decimal representation of "i * i" can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals "i".

Constraints:
- "1 <= n <= 1000"

[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 10
Output: 182
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 37
Output: 1478
