As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2161_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a "0-indexed" integer array "nums" and an integer "pivot". Rearrange "nums" such that the following conditions are satisfied:

Every element less than "pivot" appears "before" every element greater than "pivot".
Every element equal to "pivot" appears in "between" the elements less than and greater than "pivot".
The "relative order" of the elements less than "pivot" and the elements greater than "pivot" is maintained.
More formally, consider every "pi", "pj" where "pi" is the new position of the "ith" element and "pj" is the new position of the "jth" element. If "i < j" and both elements are smaller (or larger) than "pivot", then "pi < pj".
