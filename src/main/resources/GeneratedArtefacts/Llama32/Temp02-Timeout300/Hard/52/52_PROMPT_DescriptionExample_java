As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.52;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing "n" queens on an "n x n" chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer "n", return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
Constraints:
- "1 <= n <= 9"



[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 4
Output: 2

[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
