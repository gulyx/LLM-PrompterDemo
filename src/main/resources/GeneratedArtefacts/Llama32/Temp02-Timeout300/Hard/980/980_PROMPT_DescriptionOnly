As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'980_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an "m x n" integer array "grid" where "grid[i][j]" could be:
- "1" representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- "2" representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- "0" representing empty squares we can walk over.
- "-1" representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
Constraints:
- "m == grid.length"
- "n == grid\[i].length"
- "1 <= m, n <= 20"
- "1 <= m \* n <= 20"
- "-1 <= grid\[i]\[j] <= 2"
- There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.
