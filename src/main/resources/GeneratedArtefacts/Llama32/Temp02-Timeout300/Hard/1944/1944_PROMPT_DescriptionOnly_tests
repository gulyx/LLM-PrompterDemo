As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1944_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1944;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1944.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
There are "n" people standing in a queue, and they numbered from "0" to "n - 1" in left to right order. You are given an "array" heights of distinct integers where "heights[i]" represents the height of the "ith" person.

A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. More formally, the "ith" person can see the "jth" person if "i < j" and "min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])".

Return an array "answer" of length "n" where "answer[i]" is the number of people the "ith" person can see to their right in the queue.
