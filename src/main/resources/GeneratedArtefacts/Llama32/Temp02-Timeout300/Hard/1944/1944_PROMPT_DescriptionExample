As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1944_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
There are "n" people standing in a queue, and they numbered from "0" to "n - 1" in left to right order. You are given an "array" heights of distinct integers where "heights[i]" represents the height of the "ith" person.

A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. More formally, the "ith" person can see the "jth" person if "i < j" and "min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])".

Return an array "answer" of length "n" where "answer[i]" is the number of people the "ith" person can see to their right in the queue.
[--Example 1--]
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
[--Example 2--]
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
