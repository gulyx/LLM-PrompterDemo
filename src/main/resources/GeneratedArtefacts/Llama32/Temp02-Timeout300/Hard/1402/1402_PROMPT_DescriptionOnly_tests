As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1402_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
A chef has collected data on the "satisfaction" level of his "n" dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. "time[i] * satisfaction[I]".

Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after preparing some amount of dishes.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

Constraints:

* "n == satisfaction.length"
* "1 <= n <= 500"
* "-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000"
