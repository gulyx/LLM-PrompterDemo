As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1611_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an integer "n", you must transform it into "0" using the following operations any number of times:

* Change the rightmost ("0^th") bit in the binary representation of "n".
* Change the "i^th" bit in the binary representation of "n" if the "(i-1)^th" bit is set to "1" and the "(i-2)^th" through "0^th" bits are set to "0".
Return the minimum number of operations to transform "n" into "0".

Constraints:

* "0 <= n <= 109"
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
