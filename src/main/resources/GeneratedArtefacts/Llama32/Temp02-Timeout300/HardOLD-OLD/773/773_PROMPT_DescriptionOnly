As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'773_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
On an "2 x 3" board, there are five tiles labeled from "1" to "5", and an empty square represented by "0". A move consists of choosing "0" and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is "[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]".

Given the puzzle board board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the "board" is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return "-1".

Constraints:

* "board.length == 2"
* "board[i].length == 3"
* "0 <= board[i][j] <= 5"
* Each value "board[I][j]" is unique.
