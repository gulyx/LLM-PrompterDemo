As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1526_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "target". You have an integer array "initial" of the same size as "target" with all elements initially zeros.

In one operation you can choose any subarray from "initial" and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a "target" array from "initial".

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
