As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1463_DescriptionExample_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1463;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1463.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a "rows x cols" matrix "grid" representing a field of cherries where "grid[i][j]" represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the "(i, j)" cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:
- Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner "(0, 0)", and
- Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner "(0, cols - 1)".

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:
- From a cell "(i, j)", robots can move to cell "(i + 1, j - 1)", "(i + 1, j)", or "(i + 1, j + 1)".
- When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
- When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row in "grid".
[--Example 1--]
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
[--Example 2--]
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
