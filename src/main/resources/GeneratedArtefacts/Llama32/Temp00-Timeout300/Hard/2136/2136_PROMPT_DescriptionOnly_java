As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2136;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You have "n" flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays "plantTime" and "growTime", of length n each:

"plantTime[i]" is the number of full days it takes you to plant the "ith" seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked "plantTime[i]" days on planting it in total.
"growTime[i]" is the number of full days it takes the "ith" seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.
From the beginning of day "0", you can plant the seeds in any order.

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
