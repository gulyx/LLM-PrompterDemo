As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1255_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given a list of "words", list of single "letters" (might be repeating) and "score" of every character.
Return the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters ("words[i]" cannot be used two or more times).
It is not necessary to use all characters in "letters", and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters "a", "b", "c", ... , "z" is given by "score[0]", "score[1]", ..., "score[25]" respectively.
Constraints:
- "1 <= words.length <= 14"
- "1 <= words[i].length <= 15"
- "1 <= letters.length <= 100"
- "letters[i].length == 1"
- "score.length == 26"
- "0 <= score[i] <= 10"
- "words[i]", "letters[i]" contain only lowercase English letters.
