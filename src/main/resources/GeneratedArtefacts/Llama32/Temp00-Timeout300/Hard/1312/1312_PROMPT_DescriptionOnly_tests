As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1312_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1312;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1312.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given a string "s". In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make "s" palindrome.

A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
