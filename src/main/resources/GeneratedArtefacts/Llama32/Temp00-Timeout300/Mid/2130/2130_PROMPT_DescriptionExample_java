As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2130;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
In a linked list of size "n", where n is even, the "ith" node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the "(n-1-i)th" node, if "0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1".

For example, if "n = 4", then node "0" is the twin of node "3", and node "1" is the twin of node "2". These are the only nodes with twins for "n = 4".
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the "head" of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
[--Example 1--]
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
[--Example 2--]
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
