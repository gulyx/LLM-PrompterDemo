As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2317_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2317;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2317.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array "nums". In one operation, select any non-negative integer x and an index i, then update "nums[i]" to be equal to "nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)".

Note that "AND" is the bitwise AND operation and "XOR" is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of "nums" after applying the operation any number of times.


Constraints:

* "1 <= nums.length <= 10^5"
* "0 <= nums[i] <= 10^8"
