As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'654_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "nums" with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from "nums" using the following algorithm:

1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in "nums".
2. Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
3. Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.
Return the maximum binary tree built from "nums".
