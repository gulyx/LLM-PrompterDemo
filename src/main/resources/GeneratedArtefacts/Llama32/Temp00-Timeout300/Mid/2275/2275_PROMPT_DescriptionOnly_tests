As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2275_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2275;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2275.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
The bitwise AND of an array "nums" is the bitwise AND of all integers in "nums".

For example, for "nums = [1, 5, 3]", the bitwise AND is equal to "1 & 5 & 3 = 1".
Also, for "nums = [7]", the bitwise AND is "7".
You are given an array of positive integers "candidates". Compute the bitwise AND for all possible combinations of elements in the "candidates" array.

Return the size of the largest combination of "candidates" with a bitwise AND greater than "0".
