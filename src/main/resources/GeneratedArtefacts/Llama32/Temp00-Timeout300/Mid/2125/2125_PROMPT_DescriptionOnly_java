As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2125;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array "bank" representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an "m x n" 2D matrix. "bank[i]" represents the "ith" row, consisting of "'0'"s and "'1'"s. "'0'" means the cell is empty, while"'1'" means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

- The two devices are located on two different rows: "r1" and "r2", where "r1 < r2".
- For each row "i" where "r1 < i < r2", there are no security devices in the "ith" row.
Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
