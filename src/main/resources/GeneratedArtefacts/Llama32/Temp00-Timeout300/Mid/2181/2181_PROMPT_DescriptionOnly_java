You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers "separated" by 0's. The "beginning" and "end" of the linked list will have "Node.val == 0".

For "every" two consecutive "0"'s, "merge" all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any "0"'s.
