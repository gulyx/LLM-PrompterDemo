As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2181_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers "separated" by 0's. The "beginning" and "end" of the linked list will have "Node.val == 0".

For "every" two consecutive "0"'s, "merge" all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any "0"'s.
