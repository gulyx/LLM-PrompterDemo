As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2196_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2196;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2196.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given a 2D integer array "descriptions" where "descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti]" indicates that "parenti" is the parent of "childi" in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,
- If "isLefti == 1", then "childi" is the left child of "parenti".
- If "isLefti == 0", then "childi" is the right child of "parenti".

Construct the binary tree described by "descriptions" and return its root.

The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.

Constraints:
- "1 <= descriptions.length <= 10^4"
- "descriptions[i].length == 3"
- "1 <= parenti, childi <= 10^5"
- "0 <= isLefti <= 1"
- The binary tree described by "descriptions" is valid.
