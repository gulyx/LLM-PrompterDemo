As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2196_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given a 2D integer array "descriptions" where "descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti]" indicates that "parenti" is the parent of "childi" in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,
- If "isLefti == 1", then "childi" is the left child of "parenti".
- If "isLefti == 0", then "childi" is the right child of "parenti".

Construct the binary tree described by "descriptions" and return its root.

The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.

Constraints:
- "1 <= descriptions.length <= 10^4"
- "descriptions[i].length == 3"
- "1 <= parenti, childi <= 10^5"
- "0 <= isLefti <= 1"
- The binary tree described by "descriptions" is valid.

[--Example 1--]
Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
[--Example 2--]
Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
