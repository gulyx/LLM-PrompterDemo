As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1072_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given an "m x n" binary matrix "matrix".

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from "0" to "1" or vice versa).

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.
[--Example 1--]
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
[--Example 2--]
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
[--Example 3--]
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
