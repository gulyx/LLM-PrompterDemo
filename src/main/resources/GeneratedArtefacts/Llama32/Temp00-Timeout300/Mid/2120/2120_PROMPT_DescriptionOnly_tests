As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2120_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
There is an "n x n" grid, with the top-left cell at "(0, 0)" and the bottom-right cell at "(n - 1, n - 1)". You are given the integer "n" and an integer array "startPos" where "startPos = [startrow, startcol]" indicates that a robot is initially at cell "(startrow, startcol)".

You are also given a 0-indexed string "s" of length "m" where "s[i]" is the "ith" instruction for the robot: "'L'" (move left), "'R'" (move right), "'U'" (move up), and "'D'" (move down).

The robot can begin executing from any "ith" instruction in "s". It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of "s" but it stops if either of these conditions is met:
- The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
- There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array "answer" of length "m" where "answer[i]" is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the "ith" instruction in "s".
- "m == s.length"
- "1 <= n, m <= 500"
- "startPos.length == 2"
- "0 <= startrow, startcol < n"
- "s" consists of "'L'", "'R'", "'U'", and "'D'".
