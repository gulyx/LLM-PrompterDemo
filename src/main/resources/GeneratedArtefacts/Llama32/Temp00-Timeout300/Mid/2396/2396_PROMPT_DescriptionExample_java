As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2396;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
An integer "n" is strictly palindromic if, for every base "b" between "2" and "n - 2" (inclusive), the string representation of the integer "n" in base "b" is palindromic.

Given an integer "n", return "true" if "n" is strictly palindromic and "false" otherwise.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 9
Output: false
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 4
Output: false
