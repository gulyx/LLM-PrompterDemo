As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2415_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given the "root" of a "perfect" binary tree, reverse the node values at each "odd" level of the tree.
Return the root of the reversed tree.
A binary tree is "perfect" if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.
The "level" of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
