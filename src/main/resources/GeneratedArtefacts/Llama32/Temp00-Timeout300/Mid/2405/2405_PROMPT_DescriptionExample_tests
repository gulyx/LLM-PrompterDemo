As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2405_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given a string "s", partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
[--Example 1--]
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
[--Example 2--]
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
