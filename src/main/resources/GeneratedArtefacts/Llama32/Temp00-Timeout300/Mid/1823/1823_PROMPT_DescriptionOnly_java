As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1823;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
There are "n" friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from "1" to "n" in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the "ith" friend brings you to the "(i+1)th" friend for "1 <= i < n", and moving clockwise from the "nth" friend brings you to the "1st" friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:
- Start at the "1st" friend.
- Count the next "k" friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
- The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
- If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step "2" starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
- Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends, "n", and an integer "k", return the winner of the game.

Constraints:
- "1 <= k <= n <= 500"
