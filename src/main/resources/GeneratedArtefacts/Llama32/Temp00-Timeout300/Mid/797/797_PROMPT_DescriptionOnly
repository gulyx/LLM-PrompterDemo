As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'797_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of "n" nodes labeled from "0" to "n - 1", find all possible paths from node "0" to node "n - 1" and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: "graph[i]" is a list of all nodes you can visit from node "i" (i.e., there is a directed edge from node "i" to node "graph[i][j]").
