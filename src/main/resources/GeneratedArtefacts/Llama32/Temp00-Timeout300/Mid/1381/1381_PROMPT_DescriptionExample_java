As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1381;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the "CustomStack" class:

"CustomStack(int maxSize)" Initializes the object with "maxSize" which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
"void push(int x)" Adds "x" to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the "maxSize".
"int pop()" Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
"void inc(int k, int val)" Increments the bottom "k" elements of the stack by "val". If there are less than "k" elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.

[--Example 1--]
Input: ["CustomStack","push","push","pop","push","push","push","increment","increment","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[3],[1],[2],[],[2],[3],[4],[5,100],[2,100],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,103,202,201,-1]
