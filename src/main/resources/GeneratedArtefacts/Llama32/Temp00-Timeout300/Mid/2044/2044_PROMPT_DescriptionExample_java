As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2044;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an integer array "nums", find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of "nums" and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.

An array "a" is a subset of an array "b" if "a" can be obtained from "b" by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of "b". Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array "a" is equal to "a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]" (0-indexed).
[--Example 1--]
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: 2
[--Example 2--]
Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 7
[--Example 3--]
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5]
Output: 6
