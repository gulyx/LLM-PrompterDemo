As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2317_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array "nums". In one operation, select any non-negative integer x and an index i, then update "nums[i]" to be equal to "nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)".

Note that "AND" is the bitwise AND operation and "XOR" is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of "nums" after applying the operation any number of times.


Constraints:

* "1 <= nums.length <= 10^5"
* "0 <= nums[i] <= 10^8"
