As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1261_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given a binary tree with the following rules:

"root.val == 0"

For any "treeNode":
If "treeNode.val == x" and "treeNode.left != null", then "treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1"
If "treeNode.val == x" and "treeNode.right != null", then "treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2"

Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all "treeNode.val" have been changed to "-1".

Implement the "FindElements" class:

"FindElements(TreeNode* root)" Initializes the object with a contaminated binary tree and recovers it.

"bool find(int target)" Returns "true" if the "target" value exists in the recovered binary tree.
