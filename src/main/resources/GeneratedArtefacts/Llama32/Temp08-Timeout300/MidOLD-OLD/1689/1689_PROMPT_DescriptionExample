As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1689_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
A decimal number is called "deci-binary" if each of its digits is either "0" or "1" without any leading zeros. For example, "101" and "1100" are "deci-binary", while "112" and "3001" are not.

Given a string "n" that represents a positive decimal integer, return the "minimum" number of positive "deci-binary" numbers needed so that they sum up to "n".
[--Example 1--]
Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
[--Example 2--]
Input: n = "82734"
Output: 8
[--Example 3--]
Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
Output: 9
