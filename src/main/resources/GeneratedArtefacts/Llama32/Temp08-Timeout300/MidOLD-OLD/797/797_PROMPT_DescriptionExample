As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'797_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of "n" nodes labeled from "0" to "n - 1", find all possible paths from node "0" to node "n - 1" and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: "graph[i]" is a list of all nodes you can visit from node "i" (i.e., there is a directed edge from node "i" to node "graph[i][j]").
[--Example 1--]
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
[--Example 2--]
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
