As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2044_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given an integer array "nums", find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of "nums" and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.

An array "a" is a subset of an array "b" if "a" can be obtained from "b" by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of "b". Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array "a" is equal to "a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]" (0-indexed).
