As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1476_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Implement the class SubrectangleQueries which receives a rows x cols rectangle as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods:

1. updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)

Updates all values with newValue in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate is (row1,col1) and bottom right coordinate is (row2,col2).
2. getValue(int row, int col)

Returns the current value of the coordinate (row,col) from the rectangle.

Constraints:

There will be at most "500" operations considering both methods: "updateSubrectangle" and "getValue".
"1 <= rows, cols <= 100"
"rows == rectangle.length"
"cols == rectangle[i].length"
"0 <= row1 <= row2 < rows"
"0 <= col1 <= col2 < cols"
"1 <= newValue, rectangle[i][j] <= 10^9"
"0 <= row < rows"
"0 <= col < cols"
[--Example 1--]
Input: ["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue"] [[[[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]],[0,2],[0,0,3,2,5],[0,2],[3,1],[3,0,3,2,10],[3,1],[0,2]]
Output: [null,1,null,5,5,null,10,5]
[--Example 2--]
Input: ["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue"] [[[[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]],[0,0],[0,0,2,2,100],[0,0],[2,2],[1,1,2,2,20],[2,2]]
Output: [null,1,null,100,100,null,20]
