As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1669_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given two linked lists: "list1" and "list2" of sizes "n" and "m" respectively.

Remove "list1"'s nodes from the "ath" node to the "bth" node, and put "list2" in their place.

The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:


Build the result list and return its head.
[--Example 1--]
Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
