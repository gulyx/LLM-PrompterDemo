As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1347_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given two strings of the same length "s" and "t". In one step you can choose any character of "t" and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make "t" an anagram of "s".

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.
