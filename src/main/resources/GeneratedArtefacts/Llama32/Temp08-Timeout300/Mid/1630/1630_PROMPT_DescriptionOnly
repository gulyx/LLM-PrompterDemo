As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1630_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence "s" is arithmetic if and only if "s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] " for all valid "i"
You are given an array of "n" integers, "nums", and two arrays of "m" integers each, "l" and "r", representing the "m" range queries, where the "ith" query is the range "[l[i], r[i]]". All the arrays are 0-indexed.
Return a list of "boolean" elements "answer", where "answer[i]" is "true" if the subarray "nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]" can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and "false" otherwise.
