As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2079;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You want to water "n" plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from "0" to "n - 1" from left to right where the "ith" plant is located at "x = i". There is a river at "x = -1" that you can refill your watering can at.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

Water the plants in order from left to right.
After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
You cannot refill the watering can early.
You are initially at the river (i.e., "x = -1"). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.

Given a 0-indexed integer array "plants" of "n" integers, where "plants[i]" is the amount of water the "ith" plant needs, and an integer "capacity" representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.

[--Example 1--]
Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5
Output: 14

[--Example 2--]
Input: plants = [1,1,1,4,2,3], capacity = 4
Output: 30

[--Example 3--]
Input: plants = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7], capacity = 8
Output: 49
