As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1315_DescriptionExample', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given the "root" of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return "0".

A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.

[--Example 1--]
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18

[--Example 2--]
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
