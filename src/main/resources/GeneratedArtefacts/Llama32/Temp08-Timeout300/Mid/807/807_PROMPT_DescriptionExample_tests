As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '807_DescriptionExample_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.807;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.807.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
There is a city composed of "n x n" blocks, where each block contains a single building shaped like a vertical square prism. You are given a 0-indexed "n x n" integer matrix "grid" where "grid[r][c]" represents the height of the building located in the block at row "r" and column "c".

A city's skyline is the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The skyline from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.

We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings by any amount (the amount can be different per building). The height of a "0"-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should not affect the city's skyline from any cardinal direction.

Return the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased by without changing the city's skyline from any cardinal direction.

Constraints:

"n == grid.length"
"n == grid[r].length"
"2 <= n <= 50"
"0 <= grid[r][c] <= 100"
[--Example 1--]
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
[--Example 2--]
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 0
