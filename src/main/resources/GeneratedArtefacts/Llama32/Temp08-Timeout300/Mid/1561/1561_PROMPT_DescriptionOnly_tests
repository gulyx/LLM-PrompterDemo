As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1561_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1561;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1561.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
There are "3n" piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

- In each step, you will choose any "3" piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
- You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
- Given an array of integers "piles" where "piles[i]" is the number of coins in the "ith" pile.

Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.
