As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2265;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given the "root" of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the "average" of the values in its "subtree".
Note:
The "average" of "n" elements is the "sum" of the "n" elements divided by "n" and "rounded down" to the nearest integer.
A "subtree" of "root" is a tree consisting of "root" and all of its descendants.
