As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2265_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2265;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2265.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given the "root" of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the "average" of the values in its "subtree".
Note:
The "average" of "n" elements is the "sum" of the "n" elements divided by "n" and "rounded down" to the nearest integer.
A "subtree" of "root" is a tree consisting of "root" and all of its descendants.
