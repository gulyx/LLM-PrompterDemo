As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '894_DescriptionExample_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.894;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.894.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given an integer "n", return a list of all possible full binary trees with "n" nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have "Node.val == 0."

Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in any order.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly "0" or "2" children.

[--Example 1--]
Input: n = 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]

[--Example 2--]
Input: n = 3
Output: [[0,0,0]]
