As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2683_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
A 0-indexed array "derived" with length "n" is derived by computing the bitwise XOR (⊕) of adjacent values in a binary array "original" of length "n".

Specifically, for each index "i" in the range "[0, n - 1]":

- If "i = n - 1", then "derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0]".
- Otherwise, "derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1]".
Given an array "derived", your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array "original" that could have formed "derived".

Return true if such an array exists or false otherwise.

A binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's
