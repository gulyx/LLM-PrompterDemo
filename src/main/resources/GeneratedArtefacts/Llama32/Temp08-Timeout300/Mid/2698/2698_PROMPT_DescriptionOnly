As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2698_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given a positive integer "n", return the punishment number of "n".

The punishment number of "n" is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers "i" such that:
- "1 <= i <= n"
- The decimal representation of "i * i" can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals "i".

Constraints:
- "1 <= n <= 1000"
