As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2375_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed string "pattern" of length "n" consisting of the characters "'I'" meaning increasing and "'D'" meaning decreasing.

A 0-indexed string "num" of length "n + 1" is created using the following conditions:

- "num" consists of the digits "'1'" to "'9'", where each digit is used at most once.
- If "pattern[i] == 'I'", then "num[i] < num[i + 1]".
- If "pattern[i] == 'D'", then "num[i] > num[i + 1]".

Return the lexicographically smallest possible string "num" that meets the conditions.

[--Example 1--]
Input: pattern = "IIIDIDDD"
Output: "123549876"

[--Example 2--]
Input: pattern = "DDD"
Output: "4321"
