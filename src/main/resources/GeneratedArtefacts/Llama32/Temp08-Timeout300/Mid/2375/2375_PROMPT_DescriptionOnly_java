As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2375;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed string "pattern" of length "n" consisting of the characters "'I'" meaning increasing and "'D'" meaning decreasing.

A 0-indexed string "num" of length "n + 1" is created using the following conditions:

- "num" consists of the digits "'1'" to "'9'", where each digit is used at most once.
- If "pattern[i] == 'I'", then "num[i] < num[i + 1]".
- If "pattern[i] == 'D'", then "num[i] > num[i + 1]".

Return the lexicographically smallest possible string "num" that meets the conditions.
