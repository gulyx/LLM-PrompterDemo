As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1310;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an array "arr" of positive integers. You are also given the array "queries" where "queries[i] = [lefti, righti]".

For each query "i" compute the XOR of elements from "lefti" to "righti" (that is, arr[lefti] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[righti]" ).

Return an array "answer" where "answer[i]" is the answer to the "ith" query.
