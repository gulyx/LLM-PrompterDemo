As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2482_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" binary matrix "grid".

A 0-indexed "m x n" difference matrix "diff" is created with the following procedure:

Let the number of ones in the "iᵗʰ" row be "onesRowᵢ".

Let the number of ones in the "jᵗʰ" column be "onesColⱼ".

Let the number of zeros in the "iᵗʰ" row be "zerosRowᵢ".

Let the number of zeros in the "jᵗʰ" column be "zerosColⱼ".

"diff[i][j] = onesRowᵢ + onesColⱼ - zerosRowᵢ - zerosColⱼ"

Return the difference matrix "diff".
