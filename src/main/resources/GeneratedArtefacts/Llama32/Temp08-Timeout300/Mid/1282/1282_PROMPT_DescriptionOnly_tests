As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1282_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
There are "n" people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from "0" to "n - 1".

You are given an integer array "groupSizes", where "groupSizes[i]" is the size of the group that person "i" is in. For example, if "groupSizes[1] = 3", then person "1" must be in a group of size "3".

Return a list of groups such that each person "i" is in a group of size "groupSizes[i]".

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.
