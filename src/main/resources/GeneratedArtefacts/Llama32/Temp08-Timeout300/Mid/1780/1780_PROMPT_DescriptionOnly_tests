As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '1780_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1780;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1780.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given an integer "n", return "true" if it is possible to represent "n" as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return "false".

An integer "y" is a power of three if there exists an integer "x" such that "y == 3x".
