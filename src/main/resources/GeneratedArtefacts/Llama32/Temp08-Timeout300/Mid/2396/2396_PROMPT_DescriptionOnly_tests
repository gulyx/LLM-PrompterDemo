As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2396_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2396;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2396.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
An integer "n" is strictly palindromic if, for every base "b" between "2" and "n - 2" (inclusive), the string representation of the integer "n" in base "b" is palindromic.

Given an integer "n", return "true" if "n" is strictly palindromic and "false" otherwise.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
