As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1557;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given a directed acyclic graph, with "n" vertices numbered from "0" to "n-1", and an array "edges" where "edges[i] = [fromi, toi]" represents a directed edge from node "fromi" to node "toi".

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
