As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1828;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an array "points" points where "points[i] = [xi, yi]" is the coordinates of the "ith" i th point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the "same" same coordinates.
You are also given an array "queries" where "queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]" describes a circle centered at "(xj, yj)" with a radius of "rj".
For each query "queries[j]", compute the number of points "inside" the "jth" circle. Points "on the border" of the circle are considered "inside" .
Return an array "answer", where "answer[j]" is the answer to the to the "jth" query.
