As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2433_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2433;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2433.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
You are given an integer array "pref" of size "n". Find and return the array "arr" of size "n" that satisfies:

"pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]".
Note that "^" denotes the bitwise-xor operation.

It can be proven that the answer is unique.
