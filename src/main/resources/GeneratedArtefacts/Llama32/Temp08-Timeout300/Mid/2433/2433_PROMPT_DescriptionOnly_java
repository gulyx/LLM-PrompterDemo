As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2433;') for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given an integer array "pref" of size "n". Find and return the array "arr" of size "n" that satisfies:

"pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]".
Note that "^" denotes the bitwise-xor operation.

It can be proven that the answer is unique.
