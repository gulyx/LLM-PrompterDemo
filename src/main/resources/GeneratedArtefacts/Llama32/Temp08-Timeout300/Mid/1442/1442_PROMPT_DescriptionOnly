As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1442_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
Given an array of integers "arr".

We want to select three indices "i", "j" and "k" where "(0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length)".

Let's define "a" and "b" as follows:

* "a = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[j - 1]"
* "b = arr[j] ^ arr[j + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[k]"

Note that ^ denotes the bitwise-xor operation.

Return the number of triplets ("i", "j" and "k") Where "a == b".


Constraints:

* "1 <= arr.length <= 300"
* "1 <= arr[i] <= 108"
