As a professional Software Engineer, generate a complete Java class file (name the class as :'Solution', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.1817;') for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword[--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer "k". The "logs" are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each "logs[i] = [IDi, timei]" indicates that the user with "IDi" performed an action at the minute "timei".

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array "answer" of size "k" such that, for each "j" ("1 <= j <= k"), "answer[j]" is the number of users whose UAM equals "j".

Return the array "answer" as described above.
[--Example 1--]
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]

[--Example 2--]
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
