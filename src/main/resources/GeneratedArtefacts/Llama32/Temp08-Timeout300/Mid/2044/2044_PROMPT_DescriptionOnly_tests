As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit test-class (name the test-class as: '2044_DescriptionOnly_testsTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2044;') with 5 different JUnit tests for a Java class-under-test (you can assume the class-under-test is named: Solution, and import it as: 'import it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen.2044.Solution;'). The class-under-test implements the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description for the class-under-test: 
Given an integer array "nums", find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of "nums" and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.

An array "a" is a subset of an array "b" if "a" can be obtained from "b" by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of "b". Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array "a" is equal to "a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]" (0-indexed).
