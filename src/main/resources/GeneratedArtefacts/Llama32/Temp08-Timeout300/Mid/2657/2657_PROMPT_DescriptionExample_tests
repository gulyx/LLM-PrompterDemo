As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2657_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
You are given two "0-indexed" integer permutations "A" and "B" of length "n".
A "prefix common array" of "A" and "B" is an array "C" such that "C[i]" is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index "i" in both "A" and "B".
Return the "prefix common array" of "A" "and" and "B".
A sequence of "n" integers is called a "permutation" if it contains all integers from "1" to "n" exactly once.

[--Example 1--]
Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4] 
Output: [0,2,3,4] 
[--Example 2--]
Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2] 
Output: [0,1,3]
