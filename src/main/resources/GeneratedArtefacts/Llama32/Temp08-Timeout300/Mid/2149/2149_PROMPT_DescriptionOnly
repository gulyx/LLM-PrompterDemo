As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2149_DescriptionOnly', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array "nums" of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should return the array of nums such that the the array follows the given conditions:

- Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
- For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in "nums" is preserved.
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.
