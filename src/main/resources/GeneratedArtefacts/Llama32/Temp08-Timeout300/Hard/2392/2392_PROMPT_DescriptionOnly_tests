As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'2392_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
You are given a positive integer "k". You are also given:
- a 2D integer array "rowConditions" of size "n" where "rowConditions[i] = [above_i, below_i]", and
- a 2D integer array "colConditions" of size "m" where "colConditions[i] = [left_i, rightᵢ]".
The two arrays contain integers from 1 to "k".
You have to build a "k x k" matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to "k" exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.
The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:
- The number "above_i" should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number "below_i" appears for all "i" from 0 to "n - 1".
- The number "left_i" should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number "rightᵢ" appears for all "i" from 0 to "m - 1".
Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.
Constraints:
- "2 <= k <= 400"
- "1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 10^4"
- "rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2"
- "1 <= above_i, below_i, left_i, right_i <= k"
- "above_i != below_i"
- "left_i != right_i"
