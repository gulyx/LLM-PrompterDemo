As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'732_DescriptionOnlyTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text. Here is the description: 
A "k"-booking happens when "k" events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all "k" events.)

You are given some events "[startTime, endTime)", after each given event, return an integer "k" representing the maximum "k"-booking between all the previous events.

Implement the "MyCalendarThree" class:

"MyCalendarThree()" Initializes the object.
"int book(int startTime, int endTime)" Returns an integer "k" representing the largest integer such that there exists a "k"-booking in the calendar.
