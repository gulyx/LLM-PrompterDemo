As a professional Software Tester, generate a complete Junit class test file (name the class as :'1368_DescriptionExampleTest', and use as first line the declaration: 'package it.cnr.iasi.saks.llmPrompter.leetCodeDemo.gen') with 5 different JUnit tests for the following description in natural language with examples. Specifically below the description, each example is introduced by the keyword [--Example XX--] (where XX is a number), and it is composed by an input tuple and an expected output. Emit only the Java code, without any other tag or text.  Here is the description: 
Given an "m x n" grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of "grid[i][j]" can be:

"1" which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from "grid[i][j]" to "grid[i][j + 1]")
"2" which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from "grid[i][j]" to "grid[i][j - 1]")
"3" which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from "grid[i][j]" to "grid[i + 1][j]")
"4" which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from "grid[i][j]" to "grid[i - 1][j]")
Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell "(0, 0)". A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell "(0, 0)" and ends at the bottom-right cell "(m - 1, n - 1)" following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with "cost = 1". You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.

Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
[--Example 1--]
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
Output: 3
[--Example 2--]
Input: grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]
Output: 0
[--Example 3--]
Input: grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]
Output: 1
