You are given a 0-indexed "m x n" binary matrix "grid".

A 0-indexed "m x n" difference matrix "diff" is created with the following procedure:

Let the number of ones in the "iᵗʰ" row be "onesRowᵢ".

Let the number of ones in the "jᵗʰ" column be "onesColⱼ".

Let the number of zeros in the "iᵗʰ" row be "zerosRowᵢ".

Let the number of zeros in the "jᵗʰ" column be "zerosColⱼ".

"diff[i][j] = onesRowᵢ + onesColⱼ - zerosRowᵢ - zerosColⱼ"

Return the difference matrix "diff".
