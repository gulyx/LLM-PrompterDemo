A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence "s" is arithmetic if and only if "s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] " for all valid "i"
You are given an array of "n" integers, "nums", and two arrays of "m" integers each, "l" and "r", representing the "m" range queries, where the "ith" query is the range "[l[i], r[i]]". All the arrays are 0-indexed.
Return a list of "boolean" elements "answer", where "answer[i]" is "true" if the subarray "nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]" can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and "false" otherwise.
