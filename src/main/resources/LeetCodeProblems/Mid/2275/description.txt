The bitwise AND of an array "nums" is the bitwise AND of all integers in "nums".

For example, for "nums = [1, 5, 3]", the bitwise AND is equal to "1 & 5 & 3 = 1".
Also, for "nums = [7]", the bitwise AND is "7".
You are given an array of positive integers "candidates". Compute the bitwise AND for all possible combinations of elements in the "candidates" array.

Return the size of the largest combination of "candidates" with a bitwise AND greater than "0".
